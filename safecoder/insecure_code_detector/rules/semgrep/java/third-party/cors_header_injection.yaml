  message: |
    This application potentially allows user-supplied input into the value of the
    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. This header is part of the CORS
    specification. By allowing user input to specify which domains can communicate with this
    server, an adversary could exploit a weakness in this server to force clients to send credentials (such
    as session identifiers) to the adversary's server.
