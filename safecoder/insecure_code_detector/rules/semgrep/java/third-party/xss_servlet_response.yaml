  message: |
    The application is returning user-supplied data from an HTTP request directly into an HTTP
    response output writer. This could lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if the input were malicious
    script code and the application server is not properly validating the output.
  severity: "WARNING"
  metadata:
    cwe: "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation('XSS')"
    cwe_id: "CWE-79"
