  message: |
    The application was found calling the `evalScript` or `Function` function with a non-literal variable. If the
    variable comes from user-supplied input, an adversary could attempt to execute arbitrary
    JavaScript
    code. This could lead to a full system compromise in Node applications or Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) in web applications.
